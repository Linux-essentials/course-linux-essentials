# Installation

## Installing Docker on Raspberry Pi

Start by updating the apt repository and installing the latest packages:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

Fetch a nice docker installation script and execute it

```shell
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

The script will run with root privileges and will therefore request your password.

To allow the `pi` user (or your own user) to run docker commands, you will need to add the user to the `docker` group:

```shell
sudo adduser pi docker
```

Reboot your Raspberry Pi for all changes to take effect.

### Verifying the Installation

The docker installation can be easily verified by requesting the current installed version:

```shell
docker --version
```

### Running Hello World

DockerHub hosts a `hello-world` docker image that just outputs a hello world message. This image is intended to test your setup.

Do note that the architecture of the Raspberry is ARM, while most images were primarily build for x86. This basically means that most official images will not run on the Raspberry Pi. However, some organizations exists which host images for the ARM architecture such as `arm32v6`, `arm32v7` and `arm64v8`. You may also come across the `armhf` organization, but this one is deprecated in favor the previously mentioned organizations.

```shell
docker run hello-world
```

On successful execution, you should see a similar output"

```text
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm32v7)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```

Note how the `hello-world` image was actually pulled from the organization `arm32v7`, which hosts a number of docker images for the ARM architecture compatible with the Raspberry Pi 2. If you are using a Raspberry Pi 3, the image should be pulled from the `arm64v8` organization, since the Cortex-A53 is v8 with a 64-bit instruction set.

## Installing Docker on Windows

Docker uses Linux-specific kernel features and therefore does not run natively on Windows. Docker Toolbox solves this by providing a command line interface to the docker engine running on a virtual machine equipped with a Linux kernel.

To use docker on Windows, download the Docker Toolbox at [https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox\_install\_windows/](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)

### Steps to take

![Installation destination](./img/2018-04-26-1.png)

Make sure to select all components, only "Kitematic" is not required (GUI) in this course, but may be installed to manage containers more easily.

> **INFO** - **GIT**
>
> If you already have GIT (a code version control system) installed you can also leave this unchecked.

Next make sure to add docker binaries to your environment path!

Ready for installation

### Launching the CLI

To start using the Docker Toolbox find the "**Docker QuickStart Terminal**" and launch it.

The first time you run the terminal app it will setup a virtual machine and do some configurations.

Shortly after the CLI should become available.

You are now ready to start using Docker.
